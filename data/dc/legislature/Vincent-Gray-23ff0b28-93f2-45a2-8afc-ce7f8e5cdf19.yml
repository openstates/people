biography: "A native Washingtonian, \n has tirelessly advocated for the residents\
  \ of the District of Columbia for more than 30 years. His dedication to children\
  \ and their families has been the hallmark of his service. His lifetime of public\
  \ service to the District can be best summed up by a singular governing philosophy\u2014\
  that the District of Columbia works best as \u201COne City.\u201D On November 8,\
  \ 2016, Vincent C. Gray was again elected to represent his\_home ward\_on the\_\
  Council of the District of Columbia.\nOn January 11, 2011, he was sworn in as the\
  \ sixth elected Mayor of the District of Columbia. Mayor Gray ran for office on\
  \ a platform of restoring fiscal responsibility to city government, creating jobs\
  \ and boosting economic development, providing a quality public education to all\
  \ District children, and building safe communities. Throughout his four years in\
  \ office, Mayor Gray aggressively moved the District forward towards his vision\
  \ of a more prosperous, equitable, safe, and sustainable city for all.\nGray began\
  \ his professional career with the Arc of DC (then known as the Association for\
  \ Retarded Citizens), then in 1991, then-Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly appointed Gray\
  \ the Director of the Department of Human Services where he oversaw the functions\
  \ of a 7,000 person department related to Public Health, Social Services, Mental\
  \ Health Services and Health Care Finance In December 1994, he became the founding\
  \ Executive Director of Covenant House Washington, an international, faith-based\
  \ organization dedicated to serving homeless and at-risk youth.\nGray\u2019s dedication\
  \ to his community and the residents of Ward 7 inspired his first successful campaign\
  \ for elected office in 2004, when he handily defeated the incumbent in the primary.\
  \ During his first term, he chaired the Special Committee on the Prevention of Youth\
  \ Violence, and created the Effi Barry HIV/AIDS Initiative. Two years after joining\
  \ the Council, Gray ran for the citywide office of Chairman of the Council. Running\
  \ on the theme of \u201COne City,\u201D he continued his focus on uniting the diverse\
  \ racial and economic groups in his hometown. As Chairman, Gray spearheaded the\
  \ Pre-K Expansion and Enhancement Act, which established a high-quality early childhood\
  \ education program to provide 2,000 new classroom slots for three-and four-years-olds\
  \ over six years. Gray\u2019s diligence resulted in that goal being met in September\
  \ 2010, well before the 2014 target.\nGray has lived in the Hillcrest neighborhood\
  \ of Ward 7 for more than 25 years. His wife, Loretta, an outstanding educator in\
  \ the DC Public Schools, passed away from cancer in 1998. He has two children, Jonice\
  \ Gray Tucker and Vincent Carlos Gray, and two grandchildren."
summary: I am laser focused on the quality of life for Ward 7 and residents on the
  East End of the District of Columbia.
