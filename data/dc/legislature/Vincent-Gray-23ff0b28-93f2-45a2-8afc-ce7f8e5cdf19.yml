biography: |
  "A native Washingtonian, Vincent C. Gray has tirelessly advocated for the\
  \ residents of the District of Columbia for more than 30 years. His dedication to\
  \ children and their families has been the hallmark of his service in both city\
  \ government and the non-profit sector. His lifetime of public service to the District\
  \ can be best summed up by a singular governing philosophy\u2014that the District\
  \ of Columbia works best as \u201COne City.\u201D\nOn November 8, 2016, Vincent\
  \ C. Gray was again elected to represent his home ward on the Council of the District\
  \ of Columbia. He received 83 percent of the vote. On January 2, 2011, he was sworn\
  \ in as the sixth elected Mayor of the District of Columbia. Mayor Gray ran for\
  \ office on a platform of restoring fiscal responsibility to city government, creating\
  \ jobs and boosting economic development, providing a quality public education to\
  \ all District children, and building safe communities. Throughout his four years\
  \ in office, Mayor Gray aggressively moved the District forward towards his vision\
  \ of a more prosperous, equitable, safe, and sustainable city for all.\nDespite\
  \ being scouted in high school by two Major League Baseball teams, Gray chose to\
  \ continue his education, studying clinical psychology at The George Washington\
  \ University at both the undergraduate and graduate school levels. While at George\
  \ Washington, he became the first African-American admitted in the GW fraternity\
  \ system, and in his junior and senior years, became the first person to serve consecutive\
  \ terms as Chancellor of Tau Epsilon Phi.\nGray began his professional career with\
  \ the Arc of DC (then known as the Association for Retarded Citizens). At the Arc,\
  \ he successfully advocated for innovative policy initiatives on behalf of people\
  \ with developmental disabilities and spearheaded the closure of the District-run\
  \ Forest Haven institution for people with mental retardation, after it was exposed\
  \ for poor conditions and abuse of residents. In 1991, then-Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly\
  \ appointed Gray to the post of Director of the Department of Human Services. As\
  \ Director, he oversaw the functions of a 7,000-person department and directed activities\
  \ related to Public Health, Social Services, Mental Health Services and Health Care\
  \ Finance. In December 1994, he became the founding Executive Director of Covenant\
  \ House Washington, an international, faith-based organization dedicated to serving\
  \ homeless and at-risk youth.\nGray\u2019s dedication to his community and the residents\
  \ of Ward 7 inspired his first successful campaign for elected office in 2004, when\
  \ he handily defeated the incumbent in the primary. During his first term as the\
  \ Councilmember from Ward 7, he chaired a Special Committee on the Prevention of\
  \ Youth Violence and created the Effi Barry HIV/AIDS Initiative. Two years after\
  \ joining the Council, Gray ran for the citywide office of Chairman of the Council.\
  \ Running on the theme of \u201COne City,\u201D he continued his focus on uniting\
  \ the diverse racial and economic groups in his hometown. He won the general election\
  \ with 98 percent of the vote. As Chairman, Gray was a leader in efforts to improve\
  \ the Council\u2019s operations, transparency and oversight capacity, and was a\
  \ true champion for school reform. He spearheaded the Pre-K Expansion and Enhancement\
  \ Act, which established a high-quality early childhood education program to provide\
  \ 2,000 new classroom slots for three-and four-year-olds over six years. Gray\u2019\
  s diligence resulted in that goal being met in September of 2010, well before the\
  \ 2014 target.\nGray has lived in the Hillcrest neighborhood of Ward 7 for more\
  \ than 25 years. He has two children, Jonice Gray Tucker and Vincent Carlos Gray,\
  \ by his late wife, Loretta, who was an outstanding educator in the DC Public Schools\
  \ system, and two grandchildren. He is currently married to Dr. Dawn Kum, an educator\
  \ and founder of a therapeutic school for students with emotional disabilities."
