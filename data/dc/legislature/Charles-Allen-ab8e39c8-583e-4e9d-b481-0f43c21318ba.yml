biography: "Charles Allen is focused on building a Ward 6 with great schools at every\
  \ level and a neighborhood you can always call home.\nCharles Allen, his wife, Jordi\
  \ Hutchinson, and their children, Cora Neal and Everett, live at 15th and D Streets,\
  \ NE.\nFor over a decade, Charles has worked in Ward 6 neighborhoods, helping bring\
  \ about school reforms, working with small businesses,\_and improving our community.\
  \ His years of public service to Ward 6\_mean he knows and understands our neighborhood\
  \ issues like no\_one else.\nWhat makes our neighborhoods so special is that people\
  \ choose to\_make Ward 6 home, whether for five generations or just in the last\_\
  five years \u2013 because our neighborhoods are an extension of our front\_steps.\
  \ Ward 6 shares a vision of great schools we can walk to, thriving local\_businesses\
  \ that know us by name, parks and playgrounds for our\_families, and safe streets\
  \ for all. But we must ensure all our neighborhoods have these\_amenities, while\
  \ protecting everyone\u2019s ability to live, work, and raise a\_family in our community.\n\
  Charles began his career in the District as a graduate fellow with the\_federal\
  \ Department of Health and Human Services, working on\_expanding community-based\
  \ health options across the nation.\_ Charles quickly understood that to make true\
  \ change he needed to\_return to his roots working at the local and community level,\
  \ so he\_began his service to the District as policy director for the DC Primary\_\
  Care Association, where he helped bring about legislative, budget,\_and policy changes\
  \ that expanded health care options for almost\_every DC resident. Two of his signature\
  \ efforts \u2013 bringing physicians,\_dentists, nurses and other healthcare providers\
  \ to medically\_underserved communities and creating a District-owned captive\_\
  insurance company to provide free and low-cost medical malpractice\_insurance to\
  \ non-profit providers \u2013 remain a vital part of the city\u2019s\_health care\
  \ safety net a decade after he helped create them.\nAt the same time, Charles helped\
  \ found DC for Democracy and\_served as Chair of the organization to bring a needed\
  \ voice for\_progressive priorities and social justice issues facing the city.\_\
  \ These experiences led Charles to become an elected delegate for the\_District\
  \ at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston, elected President of the\
  \ Ward 6 Democrats, and serve as Chief of Staff to\_then-Ward 6 Councilmember Tommy\
  \ Wells.\nCharles is Chair of the Council\u2019s Committee on the Judiciary and\
  \ Public Safety, and is a member of the Council\u2019s Committees on Education,\
  \ Transportation and the Environment, and Business and Economic Development. \_\
  He serves as Chair of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments\u2019 Transportation\
  \ Planning Board\_and was named an\_Early Learning Fellow\_by the National Conference\
  \ of State Legislatures. \_He also serves on the NCSL\u2019s standing committees\
  \ on Education, Natural Resources & Infrastructure, and Law, Criminal Justice, &\
  \ Public Safety.\nCharles graduated from Washington and Lee University and he holds\_\
  a Master of Public Health from the University of Alabama at\_Birmingham."
