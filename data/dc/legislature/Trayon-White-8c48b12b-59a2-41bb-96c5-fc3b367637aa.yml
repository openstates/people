biography: "Mr. Trayon White, Sr., a native Washingtonian, was born and raised in\
  \ Southeast, DC.\_ He was reared by his very devoted grandmother, Jean Ann Roberts;\
  \ Uncle Ronell White; and mother, Sherita White-Kennedy.\_ They each instilled hard\
  \ work and determination into him early in his life that he continues to carry with\
  \ him even today.\_ Growing up as a youth, Mr. White was always involved in community\
  \ activities.\_ He started his very own business at an early age.\_ He sold refrigerator\
  \ magnets, cars, and whatever he could get his hands on to keep him off the streets.\
  \ These experiences allowed him to gain the knowledge and wisdom as an entrepreneur,\
  \ which would serve him well later in life.\nDuring Mr. White\u2019s early teen\
  \ years, he participated in the highly successful youth television program on BET,\
  \ \u201CTeen Summit\u201D.\_ His time on the show enhanced his knowledge and passion\
  \ for tackling social issues head on.\_ During his time on \u201CTeen Summit\u201D\
  , Trayon created a lifelong friendship with another effective community leader,\
  \ the late Jay Cooper.\nMr. White is a proud father, community advocate, as well\
  \ as humanitarian to his fellow Ward 8 neighbors.\_ He graduated with a 3.7 GPA\
  \ and honors from Frank W. Ballou Senior High School and continued his education\
  \ at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, graduating magna cum laude with a\
  \ bachelor\u2019s degree in Business Administration. \_While enrolled at the University\
  \ of Maryland, Mr. White dedicated himself to the children of the neighborhood,\
  \ in which he was raised, by making weekly trips home, to coach little league football\
  \ at Boys & Girls Club No. 11 & FBR for at risk youth. \_He was heavily involved\
  \ in the nonprofit, \u201CEast of the River Clergy, Police and Community Partnership\u201D\
  , which created a platform to do youth violence intervention in the community.\_\
  \ Mr. White built great relationships and the trust of the community.\_ He also\
  \ demonstrates his commitment to accessible education to the village of Ward 8 by\
  \ mentoring them from grade school to college.\nIn 2008, Mr. White founded and continued\
  \ to serve until recently as Executive Director of a youth oriented non-profit organization,\
  \ HICKS, Inc. (Helping Inner City Kids Succeed), which creates activities for youth\
  \ development in some of Washington\u2019s toughest neighborhoods. In 2010, Mr.\
  \ White was awarded the President Barack Obama Volunteer Service Award.\nThe year\
  \ 2011 was one of great accomplishments, as Mr. White was elected to the State Board\
  \ of Education for Ward 8 to complete the term of the late William Lockridge.\_\
  \ Mr. White was re-elected in 2012.\nEven after his time on the State School Board\
  \ of Education, Mr. White\u2019s work in the community is well documented with its\
  \ positive influence on 300 youth annually.\_ Mr. White is also known for his common\
  \ sense approach and business acumen that show youth the correct pathway to successful\
  \ living, personally and professionally.\nHe really enjoys being a community leader\
  \ and positive example for all youth in Ward 8 and across this Nation\u2019s Capitol.\
  \ \_ In 2015, he ran for the DC Council to represent Ward 8 to fill the seat of\
  \ the late Marion Barry.\_ He lost by less than 80 votes. In 2016, Mr. White upset\
  \ the incumbent by energizing non-traditional voters through his \u201CWe the People\u201D\
  \ campaign. \_On January, 2, 2017, Mr. White was sworn in as the Ward 8 Councilmember."
