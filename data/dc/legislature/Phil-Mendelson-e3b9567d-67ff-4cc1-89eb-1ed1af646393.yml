biography: |
  "Phil Mendelson was first elected to the Council in November 1998 as an\
  \ At-Large Councilmember. He served the District in that role until June 2012 when,\
  \ following the resignation of the previous Council Chairman, Phil was selected\
  \ by his colleagues to take over that role. In November 2012, 2014 and 2018, District\
  \ voters elected and re-elected Phil as Chairman of the Council.\nAs Chairman, Phil\
  \ leads the Council on all legislative matters. Phil also presides over the Committee\
  \ of the Whole which has purview over matters concerning the DC Auditor, the District\u2019\
  s budget, the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, federal relations,\
  \ planning and zoning, regional bodies (except WMATA and DC Water), the retirement\
  \ system, statehood, and the University of the District of Columbia. The Committee\
  \ shares jurisdiction over pre-k through 12 schooling with the Committee on Education.\n\
  Prior to becoming Chairman, Phil served eight years chairing the Council\u2019s\
  \ Committee on the Judiciary (2005-2012). In that role he was responsible for all\
  \ legislation affecting criminal laws in the District, as well as oversight over\
  \ the District\u2019s public safety agencies, including the Metropolitan Police\
  \ Department, Fire & Emergency Medical Services, the Office of the Attorney General,\
  \ the Department of Corrections, and the Office of the Medical Examiner.\nDuring\
  \ his tenure on the Council, Phil has authored hundreds of laws. Major accomplishments\
  \ include: establishing an elected attorney general and an independent Department\
  \ of Forensic Science (the city\u2019s crime lab); authoring Budget Autonomy, the\
  \ District\u2019s gun control laws (post-Heller), marriage equality, Universal Paid\
  \ Leave, and the District\u2019s tree canopy protection law; recrafting Mayor Bowser\u2019\
  s homeless shelter plan to close DC General, and Mayor Gray\u2019s plan to build\
  \ the DC United Soccer Stadium; establishing the District\u2019s first renewable\
  \ portfolio standard for electricity generation; coordinating an increase in the\
  \ minimum wage with Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties; and implementing the\
  \ recommendations of the 2012 Tax Revision Commission that has made the District\u2019\
  s individual income tax one of the most progressive in the nation and reduced the\
  \ business franchise tax by almost 20%.\nPhil has also been a regional leader, serving\
  \ twice as Chairman and three times as President of the Metropolitan Washington\
  \ Council of Governments (MWCOG). Four times he has chaired the National Capital\
  \ Region Transportation Planning Board. He is also a Past President of the Association\
  \ of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (AMPO).\nPhil believes that government\
  \ should be an honest, efficient deliverer of services, and that the District should\
  \ help those least able to help themselves to develop the skills to become self-sufficient\
  \ and end the cycle of poverty. Phil also believes that government must accomplish\
  \ this without increasing the tax burdens already shouldered by our middle-income\
  \ residents. Throughout his years of public service, Phil has maintained that the\
  \ District, as the nation\u2019s capital, should be a model of service delivery\
  \ in public education, public safety, and public health.\nPhil has been an active\
  \ participant in District politics since 1975, when he became an officer of the\
  \ McLean Gardens Residents Association. In that role he was a large part of the\
  \ effort to save that 43-acre housing complex from destruction. In 1979, Phil successfully\
  \ ran for a seat on the Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC) and continued to\
  \ serve as an ANC Commissioner until he took office as an At-Large Councilmember.\n\
  Phil came to the District from Cleveland, Ohio in 1970 to obtain a Bachelor\u2019\
  s Degree in Political Science from American University. He grew up in a family dedicated\
  \ to public service. His mother was a national crusader for nursing home reform.\
  \ His grandmother, who had been President of the Michigan State League of Women\
  \ Voters, was appointed by President Roosevelt to the Federal Office of Price Administration,\
  \ and was a founder of the Grand Rapids Urban League.\nPhil has a daughter, Adelaide,\
  \ who recently graduated from DC Public Schools. He lives in Southeast DC.\nLegislative\
