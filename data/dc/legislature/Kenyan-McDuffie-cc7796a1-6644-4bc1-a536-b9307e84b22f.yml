biography: |
  "Kenyan R. McDuffie, Councilmember for Ward 5, was first elected to the\
  \ Council of the District of Columbia in a 2012 special election. In November 2014,\
  \ the voters of Ward 5 honored him by overwhelmingly re-electing him to his first\
  \ full four-year term.\nIn his five years on the Council, Kenyan has established\
  \ himself as a skilled legislator and coalition builder, including having been elected\
  \ by his colleagues to serve as Chairman Pro Tempore since 2013. As a testament\
  \ to his diligent work and preparation, more often than not the legislation Kenyan\
  \ champions passes the Council unanimously.\nAs of January 2017, Councilmember Kenyan\
  \ McDuffie serves as the Chairperson of the Committee on Business and Economic Development,\
  \ which has oversight over 20 agencies and commissions, including the Deputy Mayor\
  \ for Planning and Economic Development, Department of Small and Local Business,\
  \ Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration, Public Service Commission and Office\
  \ of the People\u2019s Counsel. As Chair of the Committee on Business and Economic\
  \ Development Kenyan will work to ensure that the District economy continues to\
  \ grow and that small and local businesses have a fair chance to take part in the\
  \ District\u2019s economic growth.\nPreviously, Kenyan served as Chair of the Committee\
  \ on the Judiciary. As Chair Kenyan oversaw sweeping updates to the District\u2019\
  s criminal justice law. Kenyan successfully passed comprehensive juvenile justice\
  \ reform that ended the use of solitary confinement, life sentences, and indiscriminate\
  \ shackling of juveniles in court. Kenyan also oversaw the creation of the police\
  \ body-worn camera program, including ensuring that there was a fair process for\
  \ the video footage to be made public. Kenyan championed \u201CBan the Box\u201D\
  \ legislation that bans the use of criminal background checks in housing as well\
  \ as passing legislation to end the unfair use of credit history in hiring. Kenyan\
  \ also passed the innovative Neighborhood Engagement Achieves Results Act (NEAR\
  \ Act) which reforms the District\u2019s criminal justice system by incorporating\
  \ behavioral and mental health professionals to perform tasks that previously fell\
  \ to law enforcement officers.\nKenyan began his career in public service working\
  \ for a member of the U.S. House of Representatives shortly after graduating summa\
  \ cum laude from Howard University. He went on to receive his Juris Doctorate from\
  \ the University of Maryland School of Law, where he served as an editor of the\
  \ University of Maryland Law Journal of Race, Religion, Gender and Class.\nPrior\
  \ to joining the Council, Kenyan worked extensively in the legal and public safety\
  \ fields. He served as a law clerk for an Associate Judge on the 7th Judicial Circuit\
  \ of Maryland and worked as an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney in Prince George\u2019\
  s County, where he prosecuted misdemeanor and felony cases in District Court and\
  \ on appeal in Circuit Court. Kenyan served as a trial attorney for the Civil Rights\
  \ Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201CDOJ\u201D), where he conducted\
  \ investigations and managed complex cases throughout the United States regarding\
  \ enforcement of key federal civil rights statutes, including defending the rights\
  \ of the mentally ill. During his tenure at DOJ, he was also an integral team member\
  \ on cases to reform the policies and procedures of police departments. More recently,\
  \ he served as a policy advisor to the District of Columbia\u2019s Deputy Mayor\
  \ for Public Safety and Justice.\nNationally, Kenyan has been featured on NewsOne\
