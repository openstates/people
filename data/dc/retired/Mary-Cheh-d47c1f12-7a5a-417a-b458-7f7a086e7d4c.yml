  \ then-Councilmember Kathy Patterson, Mary served as pro bono special counsel to\
  \ the Council of the District of Columbia\u2019s Judiciary Committee during its\
  \ 2003 investigation into police handling of protests and demonstrations. The report\
  \ drafted as a result of her work led to model legislation that protects citizen\u2019\

  \ Board of Directors of the National Institute of Military Justice. A former member\
  \ of the ACLU Board and current Vice-Chair of the ACLU Screening Committee, Mary\
  \ Cheh is an avid defender of civil liberties. She was also a Founder of the Animal\
  \ Welfare Project, which worked with community leaders, activists, and government\
  \ officials to craft model animal welfare legislation. Mary also founded Project\
  \ Re-Entry, a pro bono law reform project that aims to reduce recidivism and assist\
  \ ex-offenders in their return to productive lives.\nAs a tenured law professor\
  \ at George Washington University, Mary serves as the Elyce Zenoff Research Professor\
  \ of Law while teaching and writing primarily in the areas of constitutional law\

  \ Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court. Mary has been honored by the University\
  \ with an Award for Community Service and with a teaching award from the Law Association\
  \ for Women.\nFinally, Mary has lived in Ward 3 since she moved to the District\
  \ in the late 1970s. She currently resides in the Forest Hills neighborhood. Mary\u2019\
