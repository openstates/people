biography: "First elected to the Senate in 2014, Senator Paul Bettencourt represents\
  \ Senate District 7, which encompasses most of West Harris County. He previously\
  \ served 10 years, from 1998 - 2008, as the Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector,\
  \ where he introduced \u201CSmart Government\u201D at the Harris County Tax Office\
  \ and developed a customer service-driven organization. His team created the first\
  \ major county online property tax payment system and the first county tax office\
  \ website with online vehicle registration in Texas. (His motto was \u201CGet on-line,\
  \ not in-line.\u201D) He was well-known as the \u201CTax Man\u201D for his outspoken\
  \ efforts to cut property taxes.\r \r In the most recent Legislative Session, Senator\
  \ Bettencourt successfully passed Senate Bill 2, the Texas Property Tax Reform and\
  \ Transparency Act of 2019, by a vote of 21-9 to bring meaningful property tax reform\
  \ and relief to all Texas taxpayers. This was the first major property tax reform\
  \ legislation in almost 40 years, and the culmination of two decades of advocacy.\
  \  He also continued his work on adult stem cell therapies in Texas by sponsoring\
  \ HB 3148, building upon previous legislative sessions to get  government out of\
  \ the way, allowing new therapies to flourish and give terminally and chronically\
  \ ill patients hope for a better quality of life.  His work during the 86th Session\
  \ earned him the distinction of \"Senate MVP\" by Capitol Inside, \"Bull of the\
  \ Brazos\" by Texas Monthly, and he was given the \"Citizen's Choice Award\" by\
  \ Empower Texans.  He has also been called an \"architect of tax relief\" by Governor\
  \ Greg Abbott. \r \r A champion for conservative solutions to Texas' challenges,\
  \ Senator Bettencourt has built a strong reputation at the Capitol advocating for\
  \ taxpayers.  In his previous legislative sessions he worked tirelessly to pass\
  \ conservative budgets, enact a supermajority requirement within a taxing jurisdiction\
  \ to raise taxes, (which prevented a $100,000,000 tax increase in its first year)\
  \ as well as author SB 7 which sought to stamp out the growing plague of inappropriate\
  \ student-educator relationships.  A compassionate conservative, Senator Bettencourt\
  \ has been a leader on \"Right to Try\" and adult stem cell legislation, fighting\
  \ for terminally and chronically ill patients across Texas to have better access\
  \ to treatments and new therapies.  Legislation that he sponsored on this important\
  \ issue was adopted by the American Legislative Exchange Council as a national model\
  \ other states could follow.  He has also greatly expanded dual credit opportunities\
  \ (SB 1004) for Texas students and Joint-Authored bipartisan legislation to enhance\
  \ educational opportunities for students through ISD/Charter partnerships (SB 1882).\
  \   \r \r Numerous organizations have acknowledged Senator Bettencourt for his work\
  \ in the Texas Senate.  In his first session, Capitol Inside named him \"Most Valuable\
  \ Freshman\" and Vision America named him their \"Outstanding Texas Legislator.\"\
  \ He has also been named \u201CTaxpayer Advocate of the Year\u201D by the Americans\
  \ for Prosperity, Previously as an elected official he was named a \u201CHero of\
  \ Faith\u201D by the Houston Area Pastors\u2019 Council, and earned the \u201CPioneer\
  \ Award\u201D from the Harris County Republican Party.\r \r Senator Bettencourt\
  \ is the Chair of the Senate Committee on Property Tax, and serves on the Senate\
  \ Finance, Education, and Higher Education committees. He also served as the Chair\
  \ of the Texas Senate Republican Caucus and has been named to the Redistricting\
  \ Committee by Lt. Governor Patrick.  \r \r A Bachelor of Science graduate of Texas\
  \ A&M University in Industrial Distribution, Senator Bettencourt is the President\
  \ and CEO of a tax consulting company in Houston that has grown to forty employees.\
  \ He is also a radio and television personality.\r \r The Senator and his wife Susan\
  \ are active members of Saint John Vianney Catholic Church, where Paul is a fourth\
  \ degree Knight of Columbus.\r \r Senate District 7 is located in Harris County\
  \ and includes Bunker Hill Village, Hedwig Village, parts of Houston, Hunters Creek\
  \ Village, Jersey Village, Piney Point Village, Spring, and Tomball."
