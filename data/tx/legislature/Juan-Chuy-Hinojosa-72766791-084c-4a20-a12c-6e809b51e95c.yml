biography: "State Senator Juan \"Chuy\" Hinojosa proudly represents the people of\
  \ District 20.  Born in McAllen, Texas, Hinojosa is the eldest of eight children.\
  \ He attended Mission Independent School District schools as a child, and worked\
  \ as a farm worker during his teen years. Hinojosa led the Mission Eagles football\
  \ team as their quarterback, and after graduation he volunteered to serve in the\
  \ U.S. Marine Corps. \r \r Hinojosa served his country with distinction in Vietnam\
  \ before returning home to continue his education. He earned a bachelor's degree\
  \ in political science from the University of Texas-Pan American, where he graduated\
  \ with honors, and a law degree from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. \r\
  \ \r After returning to South Texas, Hinojosa served as staff attorney for the Legal\
  \ Aid Society of Nueces County and later as an Assistant Attorney General for the\
  \ Texas Attorney General. Since 1980, Hinojosa has operated a private practice in\
  \ Hidalgo County representing clients in both civil and criminal matters. \r \r\
  \ Hinojosa served in the Texas House of Representatives from 1981 until 1991 and\
  \ again from 1997 to 2003. During his tenure in the Texas House, Hinojosa passed\
  \ landmark legislation, such as the establishment of the Regional Academic Health\
  \ Center (RAHC) which promotes physician training on the Texas/Mexico Border. As\
  \ the Chairman of Criminal Jurisprudence, Senator Hinojosa sponsored the Texas Fair\
  \ Defense Act, reforming procedures for providing court-appointed defense counsel\
  \ to indigent defendants, and carried DNA legislation that has resulted in freeing\
  \ many wrongly convicted citizens. \r \r Since his election to the Texas Senate\
  \ in 2003, Senator Hinojosa has secured nearly $1 billion for the Corpus Christi\
  \ Harbor Bridge Replacement project and $300 million for the Pharr Interchange Project\
  \ to address traffic congestion. This funding is in addition to the active $200\
  \ million in construction and maintenance projects currently being administered\
  \ by the Texas Department of Transportation\u2019s Pharr District, including the\
  \ funding secured to demolish and re-construct the Bicentennial Boulevard overpass\
  \ in McAllen. \r \r During the 2013 Legislative Session, Hinojosa authored SB 24,\
  \ historic legislation that created the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV)\
  \ and UTRGV School of Medicine by merging UT-Pan American and UT-Brownsville. The\
  \ School of Medicine is already providing greater access to healthcare and is boosting\
  \ the South Texas economy. The educational and healthcare opportunities are endless\
  \ and will serve the unique and critical needs of South Texas for decades to come.\
  \  \r \r Senator Hinojosa has also passed legislation to allow South Texas communities\
  \ and hospitals to draw down millions of federal matching funds to expand and invest\
  \ in their healthcare infrastructure and to reimburse hospitals for indigent care\
  \ through a federal 1115 Healthcare Transformation Waiver.\r \r Senator Hinojosa\
  \ has received the prestigious honor of being named a \"Top Ten Best Legislator\"\
  \ by   magazine three times. He has also been named a  \"Top Ten Legislator\" by\
  \   three times as well."
