biography: "Lt. Col. (Ret.) Brian Birdwell is a native Texan, decorated military veteran\
  \ and lifelong conservative Republican proudly representing Texas Senate District\
  \ 22.  Born in Fort Worth, Brian is a graduate of Lamar University in Beaumont,\
  \ U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, and the University of Missouri-Kansas\
  \ City, where he earned a Master of Public Administration degree.\r \r As the Distinguished\
  \ Military Graduate of the Lamar Army ROTC program in 1984, Brian was commissioned\
  \ as an officer in the U.S. Army and served a 20-year career with numerous training\
  \ deployments and two operational deployments.  In 1990, he deployed to Operation\
  \ Desert Shield/Desert Storm, where he was awarded the Bronze Star for Exceptional\
  \ Meritorious Achievement.  In 1998, he deployed to Central America as the Joint\
  \ Operations Officer for Joint Task Force Aguila to execute humanitarian relief\
  \ operations in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch.  In 2001, Brian was serving on\
  \ the Department of the Army staff at the Pentagon as the military aide to the Deputy\
  \ Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management.  \r \r On September 11,\
  \ 2001, when American Airlines Flight 77 was crashed just yards away from his second\
  \ floor Pentagon office, Brian was critically wounded and severely burned.  Of the\
  \ burns that covered more than 60 percent of his body, nearly half were third degree\
  \ in severity.  Today, following 39 operations, months of hospitalization and numerous\
  \ skin grafts, Brian has made a miraculous recovery.  Despite physical limitations,\
  \ he testifies not only to his physical healing, but the ultimate miracle of grace\
  \ through Christ.  He was awarded the Purple Heart for wounds received that day.\
  \  Upon retirement in July 2004, he was awarded the Legion of Merit.\r \r From 2004\
  \ to 2017, Brian and his wife, Mel, operated Face the Fire Ministries, a non-profit\
  \ organization they jointly founded to support critical-burn survivors and wounded\
  \ service-members and their families.  In 2004, the Birdwells jointly authored \
  \ , which chronicles their life-changing ordeal.  Through the years, Brian has been\
  \ profiled in numerous national and regional media outlets.\r \r Brian was first\
  \ elected to the Texas State Senate in a June 2010 special election, and has since\
  \ been re-elected by his constituents three times, averaging more than 85 percent\
  \ of votes cast.  In his four legislative sessions (2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017) Brian\
  \ consistently received critical acclaim and top ratings from numerous pro-life,\
  \ pro-business and conservative organizations, including National Federation of\
  \ Independent Business, Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, Texas Eagle Forum, Texas\
  \ State Rifle Association/National Rifle Association, Young Conservatives of Texas,\
  \ Texas Alliance for Life, Texas Right to Life, Americans for Prosperity, Concerned\
  \ Women for America, Texas Heritage Alliance and Texas Conservative Coalition, among\
  \ others.\r \r Brian is proud of his diverse and impactful legislative accomplishments,\
  \ including filing and passing legislation broadening access to higher education,\
  \ strengthening eminent domain laws protecting landowners, expanding self-defense\
  \ rights of law-abiding gun owners, strengthening legislative oversight of state\
  \ river authorities, increasing technical- and associate-degree options for high\
  \ school graduates and adult students, serving Texas veterans and their family members,\
  \ and authoring the strongest border security package in Texas history\u2014the\
  \ Stronger Border, Safer Texas Act.  In 2017, Brian led the successful effort to\
  \ make Texas just the eleventh state in the nation to pass a resolution and corresponding\
  \ legislation calling for an Article V convention of states.\r \r Brian serves as\
  \ Chairman of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Economic Development\
  \ and is a member of the Senate Committees on Finance and State Affairs. In addition\
  \ to these duties, Brian serves as Chairman of the Sunset Advisory Commission, a\
  \ joint, bipartisan committee working to identify and eradicate inefficiency, waste,\
  \ and noncompliance within state government. He previously served as a member of\
  \ this standing committee from 2012-2015. Since 2013, Brian has served as Chairman\
  \ of U.S. Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s 22-member U.S. Service Academy Nominations Board.\r\
  \ \r The Birdwells have been married for more than 30 years and reside in Granbury.\
  \ They have one son, Matt, a 2013 graduate of Texas Tech University, and a fabulous\
  \ daughter in-law, Ann Marie, who reside in Tarrant County with the Birdwell\u2019\
  s first grandchild, Elijah."
