biography: "Elected with strong bipartisan support in 2018, Senator Nathan Johnson\
  \ represents the economically and demographically diverse Senate District 16, which\
  \ comprises the northern part of Dallas County.\r \r Johnson graduated   with a\
  \ degree in physics from the University of Arizona, and earned his law degree from\
  \ the University of Texas at Austin. He practices law in the Trial Practice Group\
  \ at the law firm of Thompson & Knight. He has also composed music for the classical\
  \ concert stage and scored the hit television series  .\r \r Johnson passed 22 bills\

  \ earned a reputation for being a quick study who convenes and considers the views\

  \ on improving the health of Texans prompted him to author and support a number\
  \ of healthcare initiatives, ranging from medical coding to Medicaid expansion,\
  \ with much in between. Heading into next session, Johnson and his team are developing\
  \ legislative strategies to foster sustainable, economic growth and broaden opportunity."
