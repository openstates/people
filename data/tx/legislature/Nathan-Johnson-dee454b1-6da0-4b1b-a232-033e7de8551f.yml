biography: "Elected with strong bipartisan support in 2018, Senator Nathan Johnson\
  \ represents the economically and demographically diverse Senate District 16, which\
  \ comprises the northern part of Dallas County.\r \r After graduating   from the\
  \ University of Arizona with a degree in physics, Johnson earned his law degree\
  \ from the University of Texas at Austin. His background in science and the law,\
  \ together with his extensive community service, inform his political approach:\
  \ rational, pragmatic, and productive. Like business and civic leaders throughout\
  \ Texas, Senator Johnson recognizes that great benefits follow from policies that\
  \ foster economic expansion and broaden opportunity and from fiscally responsible\
  \ investment in public education, health, and infrastructure.\r \r Johnson practices\
  \ law at Thompson & Knight as Counsel in the Trial Practice Group in Dallas. He\
  \ has also composed music for the classical concert stage and scored the hit television\
  \ series  .\r \r Senator Johnson and his wife, Anne, have made Dallas their home\
  \ for more than 25 years, where they raise their three children\u2014Finn, Theo,\
  \ and Sophie. His wife, Anne, also an attorney, chaired the board of Family Gateway,\
  \ where the Johnson kids join in providing assistance to homeless families."
