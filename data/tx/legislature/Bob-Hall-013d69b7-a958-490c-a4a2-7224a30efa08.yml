biography: "Senator Bob Hall, father of four boys and husband to Kay Hall, taught\
  \ his family the importance of faith, family and hard work. Senator Hall graduated\
  \ from The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina with a degree in Electrical Engineering\
  \ and received a Regular Commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in the US Air Force. While\
  \ a cadet at the Citadel he received numerous awards for leadership. He was the\
  \ only Air Force Cadet selected to be a Battalion Commander and was awarded the\
  \ coveted Wade Hampton saber as the graduating cadet who had contributed the most\
  \ to the Citadel during the four years he was a cadet, and was listed in \"Who's\
  \ Who In American Colleges\" his Senior year. Upon graduation, Bob began his active\
  \ duty as a Systems Engineer working to develop the Minuteman Missile System during\
  \ the Cold War at Norton AFB in California, where he achieved the rank of Captain.\r\
  \ \r After the Air Force he worked in the Aerospace industry as a systems engineer\
  \ and business development manager. In 1982 he left the corporate world and began\
  \ working as an independent proposal consultant to aerospace and defense corporations.\

  \ him to leave behind the legacy of a patriotic servant for his children and grandchildren.\
  \ Envisioning their futures compelled him to become actively involved in the state's\
  \ political process and strongly believes it is time to stand in the gap for our\
  \ children, our liberties and our future."
