biography: "Sarah Eckhardt is honored to have been elected the Senator for Bastrop\
  \ and Travis Counties in July of 2020.\r \r Senator Eckhardt has deep roots in Central\
  \ Texas and deep commitment to improving opportunity for all Texans. After receiving\
  \ an LBJ School Master of Public Affairs and law degree from the University of Texas\
  \ at Austin in 1998, Eckhardt worked for eight years as an Assistant Travis County\
  \ Attorney.  From 2006-2013 she served as Travis County Commissioner representing\
  \ 300,000 people. From 2015-2020 she served as the Travis County Judge presiding\
  \ over the Commissioners Court and representing 1.3 million people.\r \r Senator\
  \ Eckhardt believes that elective office is a temporary trust bestowed by the people\
  \ who elect her. She values policy above politics. And she believes that government\
  \ exists to assure that opportunity is within reach of every Texan. \r \r Eckhardt's\
  \ public service experience includes emergency response, health care, workforce\
  \ and economic development, criminal justice, water policy, budget and finance.\
  \ Some of her previous accomplishments include curtailing the spread of COVID-19\
  \ in Central Texas through early and decisive region-wide orders, preserving more\
  \ than 30,000 acres of green space, building a multi-county collaboration for the\
  \ preservation of groundwater, maintaining a vibrant construction economy while\
  \ raising safety standards for workers, establishing a Travis County Public Defender's\
  \ Office, and instituting jail and arrest diversion programs that support justice\
  \ and public safety. \r \r Senator Eckhardt learned public service from her mother\
  \ and father and is inspired to continue serving by her son and daughter. Her mother\
  \ Nadine Eckhardt and her father Congressman Bob Eckhardt served Texas and especially\
  \ the most vulnerable Texans in the halls of the State Capitol and the US Capitol.\
  \ Her children Nadine (high school senior) and Hank (college sophomore) inspire\
  \ her daily to make Texas a better place for generations to come."
