biography: "Sen. Charles Perry, a practicing CPA from Lubbock, was elected to the\
  \ Texas Senate in 2014 after serving two terms in the Texas House of Representatives.\
  \ A life-long West Texan, he is a conservative \u2013 fighting for lower taxes,\
  \ better schools, safer communities, and individual liberties.\r \r Sen. Perry currently\
  \ chairs the Senate Committee on Water & Rural Affairs and is Vice-Chair of the\
  \ Health and Human Services Committee. He also sits on the Senate Committees for\
  \ Agriculture, Criminal Justice, Finance, Redistricting, and Transportation and\
  \ he co-chairs the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT) Advisory Committee.\
  \ Gov. Abbott appointed him to the Southwestern States Water Commission and the\
  \ Western States Water Council.\r \r In the 86th Legislative Session, Sen. Perry\
  \ championed a number of issues for West Texans \u2013 establishing a much needed\
  \ veterinary school at Texas Tech University, increasing rural hospital funding\
  \ by $100 million, authorizing the growing and processing of industrial hemp, increasing\
  \ funding for the Alternatives to Abortion program, and expanding rural access to\
  \ broadband.\r \r Of all the issues he worked on this session, Sen. Perry is especially\
  \ proud of the bills he passed that improve the coordination of care for medically\
  \ fragile children and his bill that increases penalties for sexual assault.\r \r\
  \ Most notably, Sen. Perry authored and passed Senate Bill 8, which creates the\
  \ first-ever State Flood Plan and secures funding to reinforce high hazard dams,\
  \ many of which are in West Texas. This landmark legislation is a bottom-up solution\
  \ to flood planning that will save lives and prevent property loss by increasing\
  \ coordination between local flood authorities across the State.\r \r Outside the\
  \ Legislature, Perry previously served as Presidents of the Lubbock Boys & Girls\
  \ Club, American Business Clubs and Community Partners, and has previously served\
  \ on the board of the National Council on Family Violence and the Women's Protective\
  \ Services of Lubbock. He also currently serves as a deacon at his church, Southcrest\
  \ Baptist.\r \r Sen. Perry graduated from Sweetwater High School in 1980 and from\
  \ Texas Tech University with a Bachelor of Business Administration in Accounting\
  \ and Management Information Systems in 1984.\r \r He and his wife Jacklyn have\
  \ been married for over 35 years. They have two children and three grandchildren,\
  \ and the entire family are graduates (and future graduates) of Texas Tech University.\r\
  \ \r Geographically, Perry represents the largest Senate District in Texas. The\
  \ district covers 51 counties and is over 48,000 square miles, which is larger than\
  \ 19 U.S. states and 107 countries."
