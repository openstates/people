biography: "Sen. Charles Perry, a practicing CPA from Lubbock, was elected to the\
  \ Texas Senate in 2014 after serving two terms in the Texas House of Representatives.\
  \ A life-long West Texan, he is a conservative \u2013 fighting for lower taxes,\
  \ better schools, safer communities, and individual liberties.\r \r Sen. Perry currently\
  \ chairs the Senate Committee on Water & Rural Affairs and is Vice-Chair of the\
  \ Health and Human Services Committee. He also sits on the Senate Committees for\
  \ Agriculture, Criminal Justice, Finance, and Transportation and he co-chairs the\
  \ State Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT) Advisory Committee. Gov. Abbott\
  \ appointed him to the Southwestern States Water Commission and the Western States\
  \ Water Council.\r \r In the 86th Legislative Session, Sen. Perry championed a number\
  \ of issues for West Texans \u2013 establishing a much needed veterinary school\
  \ at Texas Tech University, increasing rural hospital funding by $100 million, authorizing\
  \ the growing and processing of industrial hemp, increasing funding for the Alternatives\
  \ to Abortion program, and expanding rural access to broadband.\r \r Of all the\
  \ issues he worked on this session, Sen. Perry is especially proud of the bills\
  \ he passed that improve the coordination of care for medically fragile children\
  \ and his bill that increases penalties for sexual assault.\r \r Most notably, Sen.\
  \ Perry authored and passed Senate Bill 8, which creates the first-ever State Flood\
  \ Plan and secures funding to reinforce high hazard dams, many of which are in West\
  \ Texas. This landmark legislation is a bottom-up solution to flood planning that\
  \ will save lives and prevent property loss by increasing coordination between local\
  \ flood authorities across the State.\r \r Outside the Legislature, Perry previously\
  \ served as Presidents of the Lubbock Boys & Girls Club, American Business Clubs\
  \ and Community Partners, and has previously served on the board of the National\
  \ Council on Family Violence and the Women's Protective Services of Lubbock. He\
  \ also currently serves as a deacon at his church, Southcrest Baptist.\r \r Sen.\
  \ Perry graduated from Sweetwater High School in 1980 and from Texas Tech University\
  \ with a Bachelor of Business Administration in Accounting and Management Information\
  \ Systems in 1984.\r \r He and his wife Jacklyn have been married for over 35 years.\
  \ They have two children and three grandchildren, and the entire family are graduates\
  \ (and future graduates) of Texas Tech University.\r \r Geographically, Perry represents\
  \ the largest Senate District in Texas. The district covers 51 counties and is over\
  \ 48,000 square miles, which is larger than 19 U.S. states and 107 countries."
