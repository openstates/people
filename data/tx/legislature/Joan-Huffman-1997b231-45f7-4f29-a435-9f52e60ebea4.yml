biography: "Senator Joan Huffman started her career as a public servant in 1981. Upon\
  \ earning her undergraduate degree from Louisiana State University, she became a\
  \ secretary for the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s office.  It was there\
  \ that she became inspired by the work of prosecutors and decided to enroll in night\
  \ classes at the South Texas College of Law while continuing to work full time.\r\
  \ \r Upon earning her law degree, Joan was hired as a prosecutor and advanced from\
  \ misdemeanor court to Chief Felony Prosecutor, Special Crimes Gang Prosecutor,\
  \ and Legal Counsel to the Organized Crime Narcotics Task Force.  She served as\
  \ lead prosecutor in over 100 jury trials, including murders, aggravated robberies,\
  \ and sexual assaults of adults, and children.  Senator Huffman earned a reputation\
  \ as a fair and tough enforcer of the law both as a prosecutor and a twice elected\
  \ Judge to the 183rd Criminal District Court in Harris County.\r \r Senator Huffman\
  \ was first elected to the Texas Senate in 2008 and has been re-elected four times.\
  \ She currently serves as President Pro Tempore, Chair of the 2021 Senate Redistricting\
  \ Committee, Chair of the Senate Committee on State Affairs, Vice Chair of the Senate\
  \ Committee on Criminal Justice, as a senior member of the Senate Committee on Finance,\
  \ and as a member of the Senate Committee on Administration and Legislative Budget\
  \ Board.\r \r Senator Huffman\u2019s common sense approach to solving issues has\
  \ allowed for her to build strong relationships with members of both parties, which\
  \ enables her to represent the needs of her district and her constituents efficiently\
  \ and effectively. Her leadership has been acknowledged by numerous advocacy groups.\
  \  She was named as the \"2017 Hero for Texas Children\" by the National Center\

  \ also the only three-time recipient of the Texas District and County Attorneys\
  \ Association\u2019s \u201CLaw and Order Award\u201D since its inception, for her\
  \ efforts to improve victims\u2019 protections and the criminal justice system.\
