biography: "Senator Joan Huffman started her career as a public servant in 1981. Upon\
  \ earning her undergraduate degree from Louisiana State University, she became a\
  \ secretary for the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s office. It was there\
  \ that she became inspired by the work of prosecutors and decided to enroll in night\
  \ classes at the South Texas College of Law while continuing to work full time.\r\
  \ \r Upon earning her law degree, Joan was hired as a prosecutor and advanced from\
  \ misdemeanor court to Chief Felony Prosecutor, Special Crimes Gang Prosecutor,\
  \ and Legal Counsel to the Organized Crime Narcotics Task Force. She served as lead\
  \ prosecutor in over 100 jury trials, including murders, aggravated robberies, and\
  \ sexual assaults of adults, and children. Senator Huffman earned a reputation as\
  \ a fair and tough enforcer of the law both as a prosecutor and a twice elected\
  \ Judge to the 183rd Criminal District Court in Harris County.\r \r Senator Huffman\
  \ was first elected to the Texas Senate in 2008 and has been re-elected four times.\
  \ She currently serves as President Pro Tempore, Chair of the Senate Select Committee\
  \ on Redistricting, Vice Chair of the Senate Committee on Criminal Justice, as a\
  \ senior member of the Senate Committee on Finance and Senate Committee on State\
  \ Affairs, and as a member of the Senate Committee on Administration and Legislative\
  \ Budget Board.\r \r Senator Huffman\u2019s common sense approach to solving issues\
  \ has allowed for her to build strong relationships with members of both parties,\
  \ which enables her to represent the needs of her district and her constituents\
  \ efficiently and effectively. Her leadership has been acknowledged by numerous\
  \ advocacy groups. She was named as the \"2017 Hero for Texas Children\" by the\
  \ National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and a \u201CBig Voice for\
  \ Little Texans\u201D by Court Appointed Special Advocates for her work to protect\
  \ children. She is also the only three-time recipient of the Texas District and\
  \ County Attorneys Association\u2019s \u201CLaw and Order Award\u201D since its\
  \ inception, for her efforts to improve victims\u2019 protections and the criminal\
  \ justice system. She is widely recognized as the Senate's leader in the fight against\
  \ human trafficking and also serves on the Board of Directors for Child Advocates.\r\
  \ \r Senator Huffman lives with her family in Houston and proudly represents a diverse\
  \ district which includes portions of Brazoria, Fort Bend, and Harris counties."
