biography: "Angela Paxton was elected to the Texas Senate in November of 2018.  A\
  \ secondary math teacher and school counselor for more than 20 years, she is the\
  \ first educator elected to the Texas Senate in over two decades.  \r \r Senator\
  \ Paxton serves as Vice-Chair of the Senate Property Tax Committee and also sits\
  \ on the Senate committees for Business & Commerce, Education, and Natural Resources\
  \ & Economic Development.  \r \r Senator Paxton describes her job as a State Senator\
  \ in 3 words:  Listen.  Learn.  Lead.  From humble beginnings as an adopted child\
  \ and the first person in her family to graduate from college, Senator Paxton recognizes\
  \ that each individual's journey is filled with unique and meaningful personal experiences\
  \ that equip them to make a difference today. \r \r Her personal path led her to\
  \ Baylor University where she earned a BA in Mathematical Science followed by a\
  \ Masters degree in Education from the University of Houston-Clear Lake.  She chose\
  \ to make a difference through a career in education as a secondary math teacher\
  \ and school counselor in public, private, and home school settings before turning\
  \ her attention to making a difference in the Texas Senate. \r \r Senator Paxton\
  \ is a stalwart champion and an unwavering voice on pro-life issues, including adoption,\
  \ foster care and preventing human trafficking.  Her background in technology and\
  \ education, experience as a small business owner, and deep roots in Collin County\
  \ and the North Dallas area uniquely position her to represent Senate District 8,\
  \ which is one of the fastest growing and dynamic contributors to the Texas economy\
  \ - the 10th largest economy in the world.\r \r Senator Paxton and her husband,\
  \ Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, met as students at Baylor University and have\
  \ been married since 1986.  They have four grown children and are members of Prestonwood\
  \ Baptist Church in Plano."
