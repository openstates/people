biography: "Senator Charles Schwertner is a physician, family man, business owner,\
  \ and a life-long fiscal and social conservative. In 2010, Schwertner was first\
  \ elected to serve the people of House District 20 as a member of the Texas House\
  \ of Representatives. There, he quickly earned a reputation as a measured and effective\
  \ legislator, working with his colleagues to pass one of the most conservative legislative\
  \ agendas in Texas history. \r \r In 2012, Schwertner won the Republican Primary\
  \ for the Texas Senate (District 5) with nearly 75 percent of the vote. Senate District\
  \ 5 is a ten-county region of Central and East Texas that includes Brazos, Freestone,\
  \ Grimes, Leon, Limestone, Madison, Milam, Robertson, Walker and Williamson Counties.\
  \ \r \r Throughout his time in the Texas Senate, Senator Schwertner has fought for\
  \ the families in his district by supporting retired teachers, working to make higher\
  \ education more affordable, and protecting children from abuse and neglect by reforming\
  \ the Department of Family and Protective Services. Schwertner has also worked to\
  \ protect our seniors by authoring legislation to improve nursing homes and punish\
  \ bad actors in the industry. In the Senate, Dr. Schwertner serves on the Senate\
  \ Committees on Business and Commerce, Veteran Affairs & Border Security, Agriculture,\
  \ and Transportation, as well as serving as the Vice Chair of the Senate Committee\
  \ on Intergovernmental Relations.  \r \r For his leadership in the Texas Legislature,\
  \ Senator Schwertner has been named a \"Taxpayer Advocate\" by Texans for Fiscal\
  \ Responsibility, a \"Fighter for Free Enterprise\" by the Texas Association of\
  \ Business, a \"Courageous Conservative\" by the Texas Conservative Coalition, a\
  \ \"Lone Star Conservative Leader\" by the Texas Conservative Roundtable, and \"\
  Senate Freshman of the Year\" by Texas Monthly magazine. Additionally, Senator Schwertner\
  \ has been named a CASA Champion for Texas Children, YMCA Champion, and Legislator\
  \ of the Year by the Texas Assisted Living Association. \r \r Charles comes from\
  \ six generations of farming and ranching in Texas. In addition to his role in the\
  \ Texas Legislature, Dr. Schwertner also works as a practicing orthopedic surgeon,\
  \ treating thousands of patients each year. He and his wife Belinda (an obstetrician/gynecologist)\
  \ reside in Georgetown with their three sons: Carson, Zachary, and Matthew."
