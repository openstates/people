biography: "Senator Judith Zaffirini (D-Laredo) represents the 21st Senatorial District,\
  \ which stretches from the Rio Grande to the Colorado River and to the Port of Corpus\
  \ Christi and the Valley. Re-elected in 2016 in a ninth landslide victory, she is\
  \ the first Hispanic woman elected to the Texas Senate, the second highest-ranking\
  \ senator, and the highest-ranking woman and Hispanic senator.\r \r Her appointments\
  \ provide countless opportunities to champion the priorities of SD 21, the heart\
  \ of the Eagle Ford Shale, which has generated billions of dollars in economic activity\
  \ for our state. As Senate Chair of the Eagle Ford Shale Legislative Caucus, Senator\
  \ Zaffirini prioritizes the district\u2019s continued prosperity, and as Vice Chair\
  \ of the Natural Resources and Economic Development Committee and member of the\
  \ Energy Council since 2009, she promotes responsible, sustainable development of\
  \ Texas' energy resources. She also helps protect and conserve the district\u2019\
  s air, land, and water resources such as the Rio Grande, the Edwards Aquifer, and\
  \ the Gulf of Mexico. \r \r Through the State Affairs Committee, she addresses issues\
  \ such as bond issuances and eminent domain, and through that committee, and, as\

  \ champions preventing cronyism and corruption in the legal system, promoting access\
  \ to justice, and protecting persons under guardianship. As a member of the Senate\
  \ Business and Commerce Committee, she advocates for large and small Texas businesses\
  \ and workers, and as a member of the Senate Administration Committee, she prioritizes\
  \ issues of importance to local governments in the 18 counties of SD 21. Health\

  \ voting record, having cast more than 64,000 consecutive votes, and her perfect\

  \ violated the Voting Rights Act and disenfranchised voters in SD 21. She has sponsored\
  \ and passed 1,160 bills and 36 substantive resolutions. Showing her bipartisan\
  \ effectiveness, in the 2019 Republican-dominated Texas Legislature she passed 127\
  \ bills, breaking her record of 108 and passing more bills than any other legislator\
