biography: "A native of Brownsville, Senator Eddie Lucio, Jr. began his public service\
  \ in 1971, becoming Cameron County Treasurer and later Cameron County Commissioner.\
  \  After having served two terms in the Texas House of Representatives, he was elected\
  \ to the Texas Senate in 1991.  He is third in seniority and Chairman of the Senate\
  \ Committee on Intergovernmental Relations. \r  \r A relentless advocate for the\
  \ Rio Grande Valley and the ranch lands of the coastal bend, he improved access\
  \ to higher education to strengthen the South Texas economy.  His legislation created\
  \ several colleges and universities in Rio Grande Valley including a medical school.\r\
  \  \r During his tenure on the Finance Committee, Lucio worked to secure state funding\
  \ for South Texas infrastructure, which contributed to the designation of the first\
  \ interstates in the Rio Grande Valley.  \r  \r Lucio grew up in the Bougainvillea\
  \ Neighborhood \u2013A Subdivision of the Brownsville Housing Authority- where the\
  \ challenges of his childhood influenced the cornerstones of his legislative agenda.\
  \ \r  \r As he prepares for the Legislative Session, Senator Lucio is guided by\
  \ the values he learned growing up in Brownsville, which were enriched as an educator\
  \ and cultivated in the corridors of the State Capitol, by putting people first\
  \ and advocating for hard-working families of South Texas.\r \r Click   for a high\
