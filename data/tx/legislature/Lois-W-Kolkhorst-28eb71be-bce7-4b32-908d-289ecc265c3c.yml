biography: "Senator Lois W. Kolkhorst is a fifth generation Texan, with ancestral\
  \ roots dating back to the Texas War of Independence.  Married to her high school\
  \ sweetheart Jim, she is a dedicated mother and small business owner.  Born and\
  \ raised in Senate District 18, she attended public schools before graduating  from\
  \ Texas Christian University, where she was a four-year letter winner on the Lady\
  \ Frog golf team. \r \r Growing up in the small town of Brenham, Kolkhorst was taught\
  \ strong family values and the importance of hard work at an early age.  Her father\
  \ served in the Navy during World War II and afterwards, became a dentist and raised\
  \ cattle.  One of her favorite childhood memories is of her time working cattle\
  \ and hunting on the family farm, which is still owned by her family today.  \r\
  \ \r Her professional career began in athletic administration at TCU, prior to her\
  \ and her husband relocating to their hometown of Brenham to start a number of small\
  \ businesses.  Senator Kolkhorst also served as the President and CEO of the Washington\
  \ County Chamber of Commerce and the Brenham Economic Development Foundation before\
  \ being elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 2001.  \r \r In 2014, after\
  \ seven successful terms in the Texas House, she was elected to the Texas Senate\
  \ in a special election, becoming only the 17th female to serve in the Texas Senate\
  \ since 1845.  Encompassing nearly one million constituents, Senate District 18\
  \ spans all or parts of 21 counties and covers one-third of the Texas coastline.\r\
  \ \r As Chair of the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services, Senator Kolkhorst\
  \ sets public health policies, and oversees physicians and licensed health professionals.\
  \ Senator Kolkhorst has created new initiatives that improve women's health and\
  \ maternal mortality rates.  She has worked with hospitals to see that they provide\
  \ better care for high-risk pregnant women and newborns, and created an innovative\
  \ funding method for newborn screenings in Texas.  She has also worked closely with\
  \ advocates to protect abused children and reform our foster care system.\r \r Additionally,\
  \ Senator Kolkhorst serves on eight other committees in the Texas Senate, including\
  \ the Senate Committee on Finance, the Senate Committee on Nominations, the Senate\
  \ Committee on Transportation, the Senate Committee on Water and Rural Affairs,\
  \  the Health & Human Services Transition Legislative Oversight Committee, the State\
  \ Water Implementation Fund for Texas Advisory Committee, the Texas Infrastructure\
  \ Resiliency Fund Advisory Committee, and the Select Committee on Texas Ports.\r\
  \ \r Known by her colleagues for being a hard worker, Kolkhorst has passed legislation\
  \ that impacts every code of Texas law, ranging from classrooms to cattle rustling.\
  \  During the most recent 86th Legislature that ended in 2019, Kolkhorst authored\
  \ and passed 107 bills, many of which focused on Hurricane Harvey recovery to help\
  \ her severely impacted district.  She also helped secure more than $3 billion for\
  \ Harvey repairs and flood mitigation across her vast coastal district.   \r \r\
  \ A longtime voice for private property rights, Senator Kolkhorst has worked with\
  \ agriculture and land owner groups to stop eminent domain abuse.  To protect and\
  \ increase funding for our state parks and historic sites, she authored Prop 5 in\
  \ 2019, which passed statewide with overwhelming support.  She has also led efforts\
  \ to enhance Texas roads, ports and trade corridors as a member of the Senate Transportation\
  \ Committee, delivering millions of dollars in funding for the state highways across\
  \ her district. \r \r As a supporter of the education community,  her efforts over\
  \ the years have earned her both the \u201CLegislator of the Year\u201D by the Texas\
  \ Association of College Teachers and the \u201CFriend of Education\u201D award\
  \ from Sam Houston State University College of Education.  Recently she championed\
  \ school finance reforms in 2019 that resulted in over $11 billion in student funding,\
  \ teacher pay raises, and local property tax rate reductions.  She also backs efforts\
  \ to support the Teacher Retirement System.    \r \r The daughter of a veteran,\
  \ Senator Kolkhorst has worked to see that our men and women in uniform receive\
  \ the support they deserve, such as property tax exemptions for disabled veterans\
  \ and additional funds for the Texas Veterans Commission.  She has also collaborated\
  \ with groups like the American Legion to pass legislation to help them expand their\
  \ fundraising capabilities.    \r \r A recipient of the Legislator of the Year Award\
  \ from the Sheriffs Association of Texas, Senator Kolkhorst is a vocal supporter\
  \ for peace officers and first responders.  Along with helping to secure nearly\
  \ $3 billion for border security, Senator Kolkhorst has worked with local law enforcement\
  \ to shut down criminal smuggling networks and develop sensible solutions to the\
  \ mental health crisis that crowds our jails.      \r \r She has received accolades\
  \ for her work from the Texas & Southwestern Cattle Raisers, Texas Farm Bureau,\
  \ Texas Wildlife Association, the NRA, CASA, the Texas Medical Association, the\
  \ Texas Hospital Association, the Texas Nurses Association, and the Texas DPS Officer\
  \ Association, among many others.  \r \r Senator Kolkhorst and her husband are blessed\
  \ with two children, Lois Kate and Jake.  A frequent volunteer at her church, Senator\
  \ Kolkhorst also enjoys hobbies such as hunting, fishing and gardening."
