biography: |
  "Dawn Buckingham is a conservative small business owner who believes the\
  \ best approach to government is \"less is more.\" As a doctor, she has witnessed\
  \ firsthand how government often interferes, rather than enhances, an individual's\
  \ or a business' success. \r \r Since making history in 2016 as the first Republican\
  \ from Travis County to ever be elected to the Texas Senate, as well as the first\
  \ woman ever elected to represent Senate District 24, Dr. Buckingham has focused\
  \ her attention on improving public education, keeping taxes low, strengthening\
  \ border security, and defending life.\r \r Dr. Buckingham's tireless work ethic\
  \ allowed her to make a significant impact during her first term in legislature.\
  \ Following her first session in 2017, when she was named the Co-Most Valuable Freshman,\
  \ she became the first legislator ever to be named to the Sunset Advisory Commission\
  \ after previously serving as a public member. This historic appointment allowed\
  \ her to apply her limited government principles to the Sunset Advisory Commission's\
  \ review of several key state agencies. In 2019, Dr. Buckingham became the first\
  \ person in 58 years with two years or less experience to be named Chair of the\
  \ prestigious Senate Nominations Committee, a key position responsible for the review\
  \ of Governor Greg Abbott's appointees to agencies and boards across state government.\r\
  \ \r Dr. Buckingham\u2019s forefathers were among the first settlers to Texas seven\
  \ generations ago, and that tough, independent, pioneer spirit is deeply rooted\
  \ in her personality. Dr. Buckingham's commitment to service began early, serving\
  \ as a volunteer fire fighter, and she is a graduate of the A&M Fire School. She\
  \ is also an avid hunter and outdoorswoman.\r \r Dr. Buckingham lived at home and\
  \ worked two jobs to pay for college at UT-Austin, graduating Magna Cum Laude and\
  \ debt-free. It was during college that she met the love of her life and husband\
  \ of 28 years, Ed Buckingham. Dawn and Ed both received their medical degrees from\
  \ the Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, and they have two children. Her commitment\
  \ to service and recognition for her work has allowed her to hold leadership positions\
  \ in local, state, and national organizations."
